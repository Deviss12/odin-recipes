    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
      <li>
        1/2 pound (225 grams) mixed seafood (such as shrimp, scallops, mussels,
        and calamari), cleaned and deveined
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>3 cups fish or vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion
        and garlic and saut√© until the onion becomes translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat the grains with the
        oil. Toast the rice for about a minute until it becomes slightly
        translucent at the edges.
      </li>
      <li>Pour in the white wine and stir until it is absorbed by the rice.</li>
      <li>
        Begin adding the fish or vegetable broth, about 1/2 cup at a time,
        stirring continuously. Allow each addition of broth to be absorbed
        before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is al dente,
        cooked through but still slightly firm to the bite. It should take
        approximately 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the rice is cooking, heat a separate skillet over medium heat and
        add the mixed seafood. Cook until the seafood is opaque and cooked
        through, which should take about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes and cooked seafood into the risotto. Cook
        for an additional 2-3 minutes until everything is well combined and
        heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese,
        butter, and chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the risotto to rest for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the Risotto di Mare hot, garnished with additional chopped parsley
        and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the risotto.
