    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Polish Pierogies are a beloved dish that holds a special place in Polish
      cuisine. These delectable filled dumplings are made with a simple dough
      consisting of flour, salt, warm water, and egg. The dough is rolled out
      and cut into circles, which are then filled with a variety of traditional
      fillings like mashed potatoes, cheese, sauerkraut, or ground meat. The
      dumplings are then boiled until they float to the surface, creating a
      tender and delicate texture that encases the flavorful fillings. Polish
      Pierogies are versatile and can be enjoyed as a main course or as a side
      dish, making them a wonderful addition to any meal.

      To elevate the flavor of Polish Pierogies, they are traditionally served
      with caramelized onions. The onions are cooked in butter until golden
      brown, adding a sweet and savory element to the dish. The pierogies can be
      garnished with a dollop of sour cream or applesauce for an extra burst of
      tanginess or sweetness. The combination of the soft dumpling dough, hearty
      fillings, and caramelized onions creates a truly satisfying and comforting
      dish that warms the heart and soul. Whether enjoyed at family gatherings,
      holidays, or any time you're craving a taste of Polish cuisine, these
      homemade Polish Pierogies are sure to impress and delight with their
      delicious flavors and cultural heritage. Smacznego! (Enjoy your meal in
      Polish!)

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>
        2 cups filling of your choice (such as mashed potatoes, cheese,
        sauerkraut, or ground meat)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
      <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>Sour cream or applesauce, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the
        center and add the warm water and egg. Mix until a dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes
        until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth
        and let it rest for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the dough to a thin sheet, about 1/8 inch thick. Use a round
        cutter or a glass to cut out circles from the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a spoonful of filling of your choice in the center of each dough
        circle. Fold the dough in half, sealing the edges tightly. You can crimp
        the edges with a fork for a decorative touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the
        pierogies into the boiling water, a few at a time, and cook until they
        float to the surface, usually around 3-5 minutes. Remove them with a
        slotted spoon and transfer to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion
        and cook until golden brown and caramelized.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the pierogies hot, topped with the caramelized onions and
        accompanied by sour cream or applesauce, if desired. Enjoy these
        delicious Polish dumplings as a main course or side dish.
